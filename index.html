  <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Aaron Yoder. I was born on March 23, 1998. I grew up in New Carlisle, Ohio. I went to high school in Nebraska and graduated from Valentine High School. I went to the Ohio State University for three years to pursue a degree in pure mathematics. I couldn't afford to live in Columbus after my third year, so I'm currently taking a break from university and am instead looking to get into the industry with the full intention to return to university and finish my degree at a later date.</p>
<p>I started programming when I was 10 years old. I wanted to learn more about how games worked, so I looked up YouTube videos about it. One channel that had a notable impact on me was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject">The Cherno</a>. I found his videos inspiring, and I liked that he went into lots of detail and explained why the code worked the way it did. After some time, I moved on to developing my own projects and have been doing that for many years since. Over time I met new people, had new experiences, gained new insight, and learned lots of information about code structure and organization, good programming practices, and how to work well in a team. I have worked on dozens of personal projects over the years in an effort to always keep learning new things. I worked in the industry in the summer of 2019 as the lead developer of an Android app for a Columbus startup.</p>
<h1 id="faq">FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>Preferred desktop operating system?</strong></p>
<p>I use Windows 10 on my personal computers, but there's something really charming about Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Preferred mobile operating system?</strong></p>
<p>Android. I currently use a Pixel 3a on the latest version of Android.</p>
<p><strong>Preferred desktop browser?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Firefox</a></p>
<p><strong>Preferred mobile browser?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a> (<a href="https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix">Fenix</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Favorite programming languages?</strong></p>
<p>Java.</p>
<p>I've used Kotlin and like some of the features it has, but I personally think that it obscures too much in the name of null safety. Null safety is really only an issue in Java if you follow poor practices. Having worked with others directly on Kotlin code, Kotlin allows you to much more easily fall into very bad practices that lead to poor readability and poor stability. Contrary to what seems to be popular belief, less code does not always equal more readability. I think Kotlin is great for personal projects that you want to iterate quickly on, but I think it's currently a poor language choice for team projects.</p>
<p>Other languages I've used in the past are BASIC, Lua, C, C++, C#, Python, Haskell, and JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Preferred IDE?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a></p>
